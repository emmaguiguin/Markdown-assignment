## **DISCLAIMER**

Astrology is more of an art than a science. Interpretations are often general and it is normal that not everything corresponds exactly to you.

## **About Me**

Hello and welcome to The Zodiac Abode, where I'll be talking to you about astrology and birth charts. My name is Emma, I'm 21 and I'm passionate about astrology and its interpretation. My mother had an interpretation made of my birth chart a month after I was born, so it's an area that's always been more or less part of my life. However, I started to take a more in-depth interest in it 2 years ago after a 3-hour session with an astrologer that completely turned me upside down. I wanted to know more about it, learn how to decipher the position of the stars, their links with the astrological signs and understand their influence on people.

So I'm creating this site today to share my passion with you and give you a better understanding of astrology. First of all, you can start by reading the Astr'histoire section, which is a short summary of the history of this practice through the ages. You'll then find a page where you can find out your astrological sign, also known as your sun sign, as well as a link to calculate the position of each planet in the sky at the time of your birth. Thanks to this site, you'll have a simplified natal chart, and I'll help you interpret the position of each planet in the natal chart section.
