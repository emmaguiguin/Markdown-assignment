> *Throughout the centuries, human beings have relied on the wisdom of astrology to understand their past, energise their present and create a fulfilling future. Astrology is an ancient art. The first astrological themes date back to ancient Egypt, around 4500 BC. But it was only at the beginning of the 20th century that the practice enjoyed a revival as a psychological tool for heightened self-awareness.* *Sasha Fenton*

The genesis of the New Age and personal development movements since the 1960s has considerably increased the popularity of astrology. Its modern Western version is firmly rooted in the approach to psychological and personal growth, with more and more people seeking a spiritual perspective. The discipline is no longer seen as a highly complicated field that only professional astrologers can interpret.

It is accepted as a popular and practical technique that everyone can learn about and apply in their daily lives to reap the positive benefits. Today's astrology goes far beyond the daily horoscopes published in the newspapers. It provides the tools you need to better understand yourself and develop your full potential.

Astrology is neither a religion nor a belief. It is an astronomic, psychological and predictive system. Unlike many other divinatory techniques that have survived the centuries, astrology remains popular for the simple reason that it works.

The Astro section of magazines generally deals with the twelve ‘sun signs’. This is the simplest approach, since the Earth always orbits the Sun and the signs always follow the same sequence throughout the year. Readers can concentrate on the sign that concerns them without needing to consult an astrologer. Despite the fact that this form of astrology is limited, it remains very popular and can sometimes provide answers to simple questions. But ‘real astrology’ is something else entirely.

This is based on an individual's natal chart, calculated according to the date, place and time of birth. A natal chart is a snapshot of the solar system at the moment when the individual is born. The role of the astrologer is to relate this chart to the evolution of the elements in order to identify trends and events in the subject's life. Having your natal chart and its interpretation can be very useful. In particular, it is a way of being aware of how we project ourselves and what we feel. This awareness helps us to understand ourselves and others better. It's also very useful to understand how the planets affect our daily lives.

Studying astrology seriously is not a simple task, but it is far from impossible if you give yourself the means. This does not mean spending a fortune on specialised software. There are many inexpensive applications and software packages that can at least calculate your natal chart.
