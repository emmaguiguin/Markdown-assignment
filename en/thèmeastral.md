Now that I have presented you the different signs of the zodiac and you have in hand your astral chart thanks to the site Astrothème, you will have noticed that all planets of the solar system, as well as the Moon and the Ascendant appear on it. But what are they for and what do we learn about ourselves?

## Ascendant and Moon sign

### Ascendant

The Ascendant is defined by the point of the ecliptic where the Sun rises on the eastern horizon. It is characterized by the sign in which it is found. The twelve astrological houses start from the ascendant.

The ascendant may be more pronounced than the solar sign in an individual. So, if someone asks you to guess his «astrological sign» and you are wrong, It may be because you have identified his ascendant more than his sun sign. The ascendant can influence a person’s appearance, way of being and behaviour. It tells us much about the childhood and youth of an individual and the teachings he received at that time. If our nature is defined by our solar sign, our lunar sign and the planets, Education can sometimes have a significant impact on our ascendant.

### Lune

The Moon orbits the Earth in 27.3 days, but it orbits the zodiac as seen from Earth in 29.5 days. The lunar sign is less obvious than the solar sign, insofar as it governs our reactions rather than our actions, and concerns the hidden and inner face of the personality. More importantly, it is related to the emotions and behavior determined by how we are.

The deep nature of an individual is not always expressed in the eyes of others. Even relatives do not have an exhaustive appreciation of a person’s real feelings. The latter will be aware of it but will not necessarily succeed in putting words on it. In a way, the lunar sign reveals true motivations and deep personality.

The Moon sometimes has something to say about the relationship with the mother. It can refer to domestic themes, but it can also show if the person is in tune with the needs of their audience.

## The planets

### Mercury

Mercury is the smallest planet in the solar system and the closest to the Sun. It takes eighty-eight days to spin around, the shortest orbit of all planets. It is named after the Roman deity Mercury, the messenger of the gods.

Due to its proximity to the Sun, Mercury will be of the same sign as the Sun, or a sign from it. For example, a person whose sun sign is Sagittarius will have Mercury in Scorpio, Sagittarius or Capricorn.

It happens that, seen from the Earth, the movement of Mercury seems to cross the zodiac backwards. This happens on average three times a year for two or three weeks. Mercury is said to be retrograde. Astrologers know that these are times when communication is poor, vehicles and travel are problematic, our health can be tricky, and things can easily get lost.

In astrology, Mercury is attached to education, literature, numbers, communications, but also living and working places, travel and everything that comes from everyday life such as shopping for example. Mercury governs writing and numbers; buying, selling and marketing; buses, taxis and the family car. It is also concerned with the relationship with brothers, sisters, cousins and neighbours. It is the planet of disease, health and healing. If a person is involved in magic, Mercury will be their planet. It refers to movement and therefore to certain sports such as running and hiking. Mercury also rules the swindlers and thieves.

### Venus

Venus is the second most distant planet from the Sun. It orbits in 224 days. Being closer to the Sun than the Earth, it usually has the same sign or the one preceding or succeeding it. It may be at a distance of two signs from the sun sign, if one of the two planets is at the end of one sign and the other planet at the beginning of another.

Venus refers to what one possesses, to values. It also governs money since it is the means by which one can acquire. In a more general way, we attach to it all the things that have a value or an importance, the home, individual freedom or the things that we find beautiful for example.

Venus describes the way a person loves or wants to be loved. But it is also the planet of luxury, relaxation and good times. It can also show how a person usually dresses and presents themselves to the world.

### Mars

Mars is the next planet after Earth. It takes about two years to orbit the Sun. Mars has two moons. It expresses the way in which a person seeks to obtain what he or she desires. It expresses the assertive, masculine side of an individual. It can also show how an individual behaves when they fall in love and what they do to get what they want (love and sex). The Romans called him the god of war. Mars shows what a person can fight for. It shows how we use our energy and for what purposes.
### Jupiter

Jupiter is the first of the distant planets. Made up of gas, dust and clouds, it spins much faster than the Earth. Among its fifteen moons, four are of a significant size. The sign that houses Jupiter at birth highlights an individual’s beliefs and values. It also indicates whether the person is an adventurer and how they are trying to broaden their horizons. In some signs, Jupiter incites the person to gamble or take risks, and in others it breathes life into what could otherwise be a boring personality. Jupiter is a wonderful indicator of how likely a person is to find luck.

### Saturn

Adorned with its magnificent rings, Saturn is as beautiful as it is distant. It has many satellites, some of which are large enough to be considered moons. Saturn is the planet that all astrology students love to hate. It represents restrictions and limits. Its position indicates where the greatest difficulties and lessons of life are. It is often by overcoming these difficulties that we learn how to structure our lives and how to get out of them. Saturn stands for hard work and attention to detail. It also corresponds to old age and happiness at an older age.

### Uranus

Discovered in 1781, Uranus rotates on itself in the opposite direction of the other planets and its poles are lying on its orbital plane, so that it always shows the same pole to the Sun. Uranus is the planet of rupture. It breaks rules and causes upheavals in people’s lives. Uranus rules creativity, originality and sometimes the gifts of clairvoyance. It is associated with higher education, science, inventions and new ideas, but also friendship and relationships, political ideas and individual freedom. It also governs hopes and wishes.

### Neptune

Neptune is a very distant gas giant. In astrology, it is associated with the sea and travel, but also with dreams, imagination, creativity and escape from a monotonous life. It is related to clairvoyance, intuition, mysticism, religion and spirituality, art, music, and everything that makes life pleasant. In its dark part, Neptune prevents us from seeing the truth, creates confusion, misunderstandings, illusions, disappointments and sudden revelations. Neptune rules artificial havens, alcohol or drugs. It is also connected to kindness and goodness.

### Pluto

Technically, Pluto is a dwarf planet. Its elliptical course takes it far beyond Neptune, and then returns to the orbit of Neptune. Pluto’s moon, Charon, is so large that it becomes a double planet, a pair of planets orbiting around the same center.

Pluto manages the transformation, up to destruction in order to better rebuild. Due to its association with the union and partnerships, it is linked to shared resources, large sums of money, taxes, loans and inheritances. The union may also involve sexual relations and major family issues such as birth and death, gains and losses. It may be related to recycling, such as the use of an object in a different way from what it was made for. This planet governs deep thoughts and feelings.

### Chiron

Chiron is a centaur-class asteroid used since the late 1970s. It governs health and changes in partnerships and relationships. It focuses on where the deepest psychological wound is found in an individual.
